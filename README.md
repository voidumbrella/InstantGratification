# Instant Gratification
**Instant Gratification** is a mod that turns time into a resource in Balatro.
Every blind comes with a timer, and the following actions spend time (by default):

- **Playing a hand**: 30 seconds
- **Discarding a card**: 20 seconds
- **Shuffling the deck when it's empty**: 60 seconds

After a round, you earn money based on the remaining time.

I mostly made this on a whim without thinking too much about the balance, so the numbers and details are subject to change.
